This year, I successfully contributed to fostering an inclusive and positive workplace culture by achieving key objectives. I established a San Diego office-wide coed softball team, now entering its third season with over 25 employees participating. Additionally, I supported the creation of a soccer club by sharing my knowledge with Wyatt, promoting further engagement within the office. I actively participated in all required DEI and ethics training sessions, and I completed my mentorship with Setthachuea Phanitchaphon, graduating from our mentor/mentee relationship. These efforts align with my goal of encouraging peer involvement, promoting knowledge sharing, and maintaining compliance with company requirements.

In alignment with my objective to advocate for product innovation through Digital Engineering and Model-Based Engineering (MBE) methods, I made several key contributions this year. I collaborated with systems engineers to generate essential data, develop software workflows, and create detailed diagrams. Additionally, I conducted a comprehensive trade study comparing database options such as Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Neo4j to support informed decision-making for future projects. Furthermore, I captured the tool acquisition process using SysML diagrams, documenting the flow and promoting MBSE design tenants in these processes.

This year, I applied knowledge from previous programs (MAIN SAIL/GEOINT) to the GEM Cutter program and made significant progress toward my objectives. I captured and organized software artifacts in the wiki, creating a repository for effective knowledge sharing, which aligns with delivering artifacts using team-defined best practices. I consistently completed Jira tasks and tickets on time, supporting on-time delivery and product development acceleration. I graduated from the year one program and from my mentor/mentee relationship, achieving my mentorship goals.
In addition, I actively participated in technical exchange meetings (TEMs), where I proposed software design solutions and shared software artifacts with tech leads and customers during demos, demonstrating my understanding of MBSE tenants and stakeholder needs. Through these engagements, I gained a deeper understanding of Enforma and GEM Cutter's goals, contributing to program execution and process refinement.

Throughout the year, I completed my software tasks in a timely manner, contributing to the overall goals of the project and aligning with the 90% on-time task completion objective. I actively attended and participated in all key scrum ceremonies, including stand-ups, retrospectives, backlog grooming, and iteration planning, ensuring my involvement in engineering discussions and decision-making processes.
Under the mentorship of Andy Spydell, Curtis George, and Ronny Liu, I developed backend software solutions, adhering to the GEM Cutter software development process and focusing on reducing bugs and code errors by addressing code smell and incorporating feedback from merge requests. Additionally, I took initiative to assist with setting up rooms for demos, stand-ups, and other ceremonies when our scrum lead was unavailable, demonstrating leadership in facilitating team operations.

I actively attended book study sessions, learning about the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), which emphasizes the importance of a consistent software model for all stakeholders. While I havenâ€™t yet had the opportunity to apply this knowledge directly to the GEM Cutter program due to the domain-agnostic nature of Enforma, I am equipped with a deeper understanding of DDD principles that can be applied when relevant to future program needs

I enrolled in the Computer Science program at San Diego State University and began classes in the fall, in line with my objective to enhance my contributions to the GEM Cutter program. I am currently halfway through the semester, having completed all assignments and on track to pass with all A's. The courses most relevant to my work are Advanced Object-Oriented Design and Programming and Principles & Techniques of Data Science

I support the intern program by fostering an inclusive and enjoyable experience for all participating interns. I oversee a pod of 3-4 interns, ensuring their concerns are heard and addressed promptly. I actively participate in organizing intern events such as the True Colors event, welcome ice breaker events, intern dinners, and outings. Additionally, I will assist with the 2025 intern hiring process by shadowing interviews and taking notes. I also attend weekly pod leader tag-ups to ensure we meet the goals of the intern program and continuously improve the experience for all interns.
