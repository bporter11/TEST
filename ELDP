What aspects of leadership are most important for you to develop?

The journey of leadership is continuous and multifaceted. As I embark on this path, there are specific aspects of leadership that I am keen to develop:

Technical Leadership: My primary goal is to enhance my technical leadership skills. This involves a deep dive into learning and mastering the myriad tools, technologies, and domains within the company. By doing so, I can confidently lead and guide others, fostering an environment of technical excellence and innovation.

Leading by Example: I believe in the power of example. It’s crucial for me to embody the principles I advocate, ensuring that I never ask of my team what I wouldn’t be willing to do myself. This approach not only earns respect but also sets a high standard for the team’s performance.

Integrity: Integrity is the cornerstone of trust. I am committed to doing the right thing, even when no one is watching. It’s about aligning actions with values and ensuring that every decision upholds the highest ethical standards.

Accountability: Being accountable to those around me means taking responsibility for my actions and their outcomes. It’s about owning up to mistakes, learning from them, and making amends where necessary. This transparency builds trust and encourages others to do the same.

Honesty: Honesty with myself about my capabilities and with others about what is happening is vital. It fosters an atmosphere of openness and encourages a culture where feedback is valued and utilized for growth.

I envision using these leadership skills to make a lasting impact both in my life and within the company. Whether it’s becoming a technical lead on a program, running campus initiatives through communities of practice, or mentoring through year one programs, these skills will be the foundation upon which I build a legacy of effective and inspiring leadership.


Who has inspired you in your career?
Throughout my career, I have been fortunate to be surrounded by individuals whose actions and values have profoundly shaped my professional journey and personal growth.

My Mother: My mother, a pioneering woman engineer who navigated the challenges of a male-dominated industry, has been a beacon of inspiration. Her ascent to the role of project manager, coupled with her ability to handle her position with dignity and grace, has shown me the power of perseverance and the importance of maintaining one’s composure in the face of adversity.

My Father: My father, who runs his own business, exemplifies the essence of leadership. His dedication to connecting with each employee, regardless of his busy schedule, has taught me the value of personal touch and the impact it can have on a team’s morale and loyalty.

Russell Deich: Russell Deich, who oversees the training programs on campus, has been a mentor to me. His ability to distill complex concepts into understandable lessons for any audience is nothing short of remarkable. His guidance has been instrumental in broadening my understanding of various aspects within BAE Systems.

Michael Hornbeeke: Similarly, Michael Hornbeeke’s talent for demystifying technical concepts for diverse audiences has been incredibly inspiring. His approach has reinforced my belief in the importance of clear communication in technical leadership.

Inspired by these role models, I aspire to influence others by being transparent, honest, and humble. I believe in sharing not only my successes but also the challenges I’ve faced, using my experiences to uplift and empower those around me. My passion for knowledge and growth is something I hope to impart to others, demonstrating that continuous learning is a lifelong endeavor.

To start inspiring others, I will:

Lead by Example: Just as my mother and father have done, I will strive to demonstrate the qualities I value in my day-to-day actions.
Mentorship: Following in the footsteps of Russell and Michael, I will take the time to educate and guide others, breaking down complex ideas to foster understanding and growth.
