BAE Softball Team Wraps Up Inaugural Season with Big Wins On and Off the Field!

Our inaugural season of the BAE softball team came to an exciting end this May. While we ended the season with a losing record, the true victories were the unforgettable moments and camaraderie we shared both on and off the field.

Here are some highlights that made this season truly special:

Michael Hoving crushed it with three spectacular home runs!
Jessica Wood stepped up as our starting shortstop, executing multiple double plays with finesse.
Andrew Edmonston was a defensive powerhouse at third base, consistently delivering lights-out performances.
These moments, along with countless others, have cemented our team's spirit and determination.

Now, onto the current season which kicked off in June. We're thrilled to announce that we're still undefeated with a record of 0-0-2. While we haven’t clinched a win just yet, we haven't faced a loss either! This perfect balance has only fueled our excitement and determination.

We’re eagerly looking forward to making more memories, sharing more laughs, and hopefully bringing glory to the BAE name! Stay tuned for more updates and cheer us on as we aim for the top!
