As of my last update in January 2022, there are several quantum computing algorithms that have been developed for various tasks. Here are some of the most notable ones:

1. **Shor's Algorithm**: Developed by mathematician Peter Shor, this algorithm efficiently factors large integers, which has significant implications for breaking certain cryptographic systems, such as RSA.

2. **Grover's Algorithm**: Developed by Lov Grover, this algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems, offering a significant advantage over classical algorithms.

3. **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)**: This is a quantum version of the discrete Fourier transform, which is used in many quantum algorithms, including Shor's algorithm.

4. **Simon's Algorithm**: This algorithm solves the Simon's problem, which has implications for breaking certain cryptographic systems and demonstrates quantum parallelism.

5. **Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)**: This algorithm is used to estimate the eigenvalues of unitary operators, which is a key subroutine in many quantum algorithms, including Shor's and Grover's algorithms.

6. **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)**: This is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm used for finding the ground state energy of a given Hamiltonian, which has applications in quantum chemistry and materials science.

7. **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)**: Developed for combinatorial optimization problems, QAOA aims to find approximate solutions using quantum circuits.

8. **HHL Algorithm**: The HHL (Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd) algorithm is designed to solve systems of linear equations, which has potential applications in fields such as machine learning and quantum finance.

9. **Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE)**: This algorithm estimates the probability of measuring a certain state, which is useful in many quantum algorithms for evaluating amplitudes.

10. **Hidden Shift and Hidden Subgroup Algorithms**: These algorithms are used to find hidden structures in functions or groups, which have implications in cryptography and algorithmic number theory.

These are just a few examples, and research in quantum algorithms is ongoing, with new algorithms and improvements being developed regularly. It's important to note that many of these algorithms are still theoretical or have only been demonstrated on small-scale quantum computers, and there's ongoing research to improve their scalability and practicality.
